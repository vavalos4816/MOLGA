Welcome to the "Make Our Logo Great Again" game. 

INSTRUCTIONS
Open the i-want-to-play-a-game.html file with any browser (Chrome, Mozilla or Edge)
Enter your name in the first screen (at least 3 characters, no numbers, no special characters)
In the second screen, drag the images into the holders on the bottom section. For each image dragged in the wrong slot, your time will be increased by 10 seconds. 
The goal is to drag all the images in the right slots as quick as possible. Once you have all the images in the same order as the ZOOVU logo, you will see a message with you current score. After 10 seconds, the game will start again.
GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN!
